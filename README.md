# WuFu
A type of fuzzing framework in which you can add fuzzers like modules and can use it almost like Metasploit/Empire :)
It was a small idea i had in my mind not a big contribution for now, but i request you to show your creativity

Currently in development stage and yet to have more functionalities. So i recommend you to DM us on twitter,
and let us know what you have in your mind for it :)
